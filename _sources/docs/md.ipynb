    "\n",
    "A fully quantum mechanical treatment is very costly, and thus only applicable for relatively small systems. This means that unless new approximations are introduced, many systems that are of interest will be far beyond the capabilities of todayâ€™s computers. A small piece of protein from the human body can consist of several thousand atoms, and even very small systems can increase by hundreds of atoms when a solvent is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation of large proteins and long time-scales can instead be consider using molecular dynamics (MD), in which we use simple Newtonian physics on entities (e.g. atoms) constructed to emulate the behavior of the molecular system. In this chapter we will introduce the basics for running an MD simulation with [openMM](https://openmm.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenMM\n",
    "OpenMM offers a high-performance toolkit for molecular simulations. It consists of a library of simulation features and an application layer, allowing end-users to use the program directly. The application layer allows openMM to be run as a stand-alone program, which is what we exploit in this course. "
