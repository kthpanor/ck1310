# Chemistry modeling

In chemistry, theoretical models are used to rationalize and better understand a wide range of phenomena. We will put a few selected methods in context via application examples and individual lab work to show how they can be used to address concrete chemical questions:

- [Quantum chemistry](sec:qc): For the simulation of the spectroscopic properties of molecules.
- [Molecular dynamics](sec:md): For the simulation of the dynamics of molecules.
- [Data analysis](sec:data): For the presentation of the simulation results.
