    "# Quantum chemistry\n",
    "With quantum chemistry, one can gain insight into matter at its fundamental scale. It is possible to model complex chemical processes on personal laptops as well as in high performance computing (HPC) environments. However, quantum chemistry is very complex. Several quantum chemistry software packages exist, and to answer a chemical question one is required to select a model system, electronic structure method, basis set, parameters, properties, and etc., among a wide and varied set of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will apply the Python-driven software package [VeloxChem](https://veloxchem.org/docs/intro.html) for the quantum chemical simulations. A simple application of the program is presented below.\n",

    "## Veloxchem\n",
    "Veloxchem [RLV+20] is an electronic structure program for the calculation of spectroscopic properties of molecular systems. It has been designed to provide both a platform for high-performance scientific computing, as well as a platform for interactive quantum chemistry via a Jupyter notebook."
