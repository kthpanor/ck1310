# Software installation

Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The conda repository contains a large number of open-source certified packages enabling scientific work. It is recommended that you install the minimal installer for conda named miniconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.

## Download and install miniconda

Retrieve miniconda from the following website

> <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>

Install the version for 64 bit computers.

## Create conda environment and install packages

### Step-by-step

Start a conda terminal, or Anaconda Powershell as it is referred to on a Windows system. Conda supports multiple *environments* and you start in the one named `base` as is typically indicated by the prompt. To create a new and additional environment named `ck1310`, enter the following command line statement

```
conda create -n ck1310
```

You can list your conda environments

```
conda env list
```

The activated environment will be marked with an asterisk (the `base` environment to begin with) and you can activate your new environment with the command

```
conda activate ck1310
```

as should be indicated by getting a modified prompt.

Install packages into this environment

```
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyterlab -c conda-forge
```

### All in one step

Get all packages needed for course in one step with use of a YML file

```
conda env create -f ck1310.yml
```

where the file `ck1310.yml` should contain

```
name: ck1310
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - veloxchem
dependencies:
  - python>=3.8
  - jupyterlab
  - jupyterlab-spellchecker
  - jupyterlab_code_formatter
  - black
  - isort
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - k3d
  - py3dmol
  - openmm
  - veloxchem
  - pandas
  - openpyxl
  - pyarrow
```

Some additional features are then made available in your notebooks such as a spell checker and a Python code formatter.

## Try it out

You should now be ready to start a Jupyter notebook with the command

```
jupyter-lab
```

which should open in your default web browser. A notebook allows for interactive execution of Python code written into cells.

## If your notebook doesnâ€™t run

If you experience issues with a crashing kernel when running Veloxchem, this may relate to several OpenMP runtimes linked to the program, which causes the kernel to die. If your kernel dies, try rerunning the notebook with the below lines added in connection to the module imports. This is an undocumented, temporary solution, but we have so far not had any problems when using it.

```
import veloxchem as vlx
...

import os
os.environ["KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK"] = "TRUE"
```
