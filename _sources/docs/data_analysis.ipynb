    "\n",
    "[Data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis) is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information. As part of the field of [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science), data analysis is today of paramount importance in many sciences, including chemistry and life sciences.\n",

    "Data visualization provides a set of techniques to make sense of collected or calculated data and effectively gain and communicate insights. \n",
    "It aids data analysis by giving a visual representation from which one can identify patterns, distributions, and correlations and spot outliers.\n",
    "Visuals allow us to summarize complex data and present it in an understandable and accessible format. Graphs, charts, and maps are examples of graphical representations of data.\n",
